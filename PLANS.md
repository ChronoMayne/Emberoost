"Binary-Breaking" 1.15 Changes and plans
========================================
Some these probably won't work, some may. who knows, exactly why theyre plans

- massive clean up (util package looks like a dead whale's guts exploded)

- make data generators easier to use and actually not make peoples eyes desintegrate from cancer

- Universatility: 
    - *Maybe* Find a way to remove the need for entity renderers?
     (Make a "DefaultRenderer" where textures can be obtained thru the model class?) Of course, there'll be way(s) to
     override this for alternative needs.
