"Binary-Breaking" 1.15 Changes and plans
- Change the data system to make more sense. data keys should start with capital letters. Ex: "HomePos",
    HomePos should be using blockpos.fromLong and toLong. Yeah im retarded.
    and remove data fixers - This whole thing WILL remove all current wyrmroost entities in world.
    tbh, not my problem. this is a caution all users take when updating.
- Add a "data helper" system to make reading, writing, and OPTIONAL dataManager registering
- Completely re-work the staff complete with an GUI and properly rendering outlining the bounded dragon
    currently not "exactly" possible with <1.15 limiting rendering
- Make many, MANY more things universal
- contemplate a client package
- massive clean up (util package looks like a dead whale's guts exploded)
- make data generators easier to use and actually not make peoples eyes desintegrate from cancer
- "Special" dragons will hook off of "Variant" and instead use -1 as the value. No sense in having a boolean for another texture change...
- piss everyone off
- delete this file
