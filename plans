"Binary-Breaking" 1.15 Changes and plans
- Change the data system to make more sense. data keys should start with capital letters. Ex: "HomePos",
    and remove data fixers - This whole thing WILL remove all current wyrmroost entities in world.
    tbh, not my problem. this is a caution all users take when updating.
- Add a "data helper" system to make reading, writing, and OPTIONAL dataManager registering
- Completely re-work the staff complete with an GUI and properly rendering outlining the bounded dragon
    currently not "exactly" possible with <1.15 limiting rendering
- Make many, MANY more things universal
- contemplate a client package - follow vanilla bullshit, sEpErAtE cLiEnT fRoM sErVEr
- massive clean up (util package looks like a dead whale's guts exploded)
- make data generators easier to use and actually not make peoples eyes desintegrate from cancer
- "Special" dragons will hook off of "Variant" and instead use -1 as the value. No sense in having a boolean for another texture change...
- Rework the animation system; make it similar to goal tasks (debating if this is even gonna work or not because logical sides...):
    * animate(Entity, Model, Tick (int)) Method - client side, actual animation of the model. Pass in the entity, entity model, and the current animation tick
    * tick(Entity, Tick (int)) Method - common, controls what to do during the animation. Actions should be done through tick checks. eg. `if (tick == 2) playSound(...)`
    * some priority system similar to goals? add flags to if it overrides idles, movements, etc.
    * OR, make a new goal selector ("animationSelector") and create a base AnimationGoal with the above functions.
        Have the selector run on both client and server for best control
- piss everyone off
