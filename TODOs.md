Plans and TODO's
========================================
Some of these probably won't work, some may. who knows, exactly why theyre plans

- Clean up classes
- Nicer Data Generators
    - Also `sounds.json` generator
- Universatility:
    - *Maybe* Find a way to remove the need for entity renderers?
      (Make a "DefaultRenderer" where textures can be obtained thru the model class?) Of course, there'll be way(s) to
      override this for alternative needs.
- Fix the Staff rendering
- Fix All flyers ai and movements
- Fix Animations to interpolate TO positions, not FROM.
- Optimize the fuck out of attacks. 
- Add Model Physics. (tails etc)
- Better Sleep System
